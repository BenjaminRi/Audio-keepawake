Pulseaudio is per-user! ( https://askubuntu.com/questions/1379890/how-to-play-a-sound-from-a-systemd-service-on-ubuntu )

```ini
Environment="XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/run/user/1000"
```

If you run a system-wide systemd service, you need to hardcode the user:

```ini
[Service]
# TODO: How to select current user ID without hardcoding it?
User=foo
Group=foo
Environment="XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/run/user/1000"
Environment="SDL_AUDIODRIVER=pipewire"
```

If we do not set current user like this:

```
User=foo
```

the following happens:

```
# audio-keepawake[40548]: XDG_RUNTIME_DIR (/run/user/1000) is not owned by us (uid 0), but by uid 1000! (This could e.g. happen if you try to connect to a non-root PulseAudio as a root user, over the native protocol. Don't do that.)
```

-> Better install it per user!

SDL Event queue seems to be hanging indefinitely, implemented workaround by polling slowly.
